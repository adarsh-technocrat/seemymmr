Follow these 4 simple steps to start tracking your website visitors and revenue.

## Step 1: Create an account

Sign up for a PostMetric account at [your-dashboard-url]. You'll get access to your dashboard where you can manage all your websites.

## Step 2: Add your website

1. Click **"Add Website"** in your dashboard
2. Enter your website name and domain
3. Click **"Create"**

Your website will be created with a unique tracking code.

## Step 3: Install the tracking script

Copy the tracking script from your dashboard and add it to your website. The script will be generated automatically for your website.

### Basic installation

Add this script to the `<head>` section of your website:

```html
<script src="https://your-domain.com/api/track.js?site=YOUR_TRACKING_CODE"></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_TRACKING_CODE` with the tracking code from your dashboard.

### Next.js installation

For Next.js projects, add the script to your `app/layout.tsx` or `pages/_app.tsx`:

```tsx
import Script from "next/script";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <Script
          src="https://your-domain.com/api/track.js?site=YOUR_TRACKING_CODE"
          strategy="afterInteractive"
        />
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

<Note>
  The tracking script automatically tracks page views and supports single-page
  applications (SPA) out of the box.
</Note>

## Step 4: Verify tracking

1. Visit your website
2. Go back to your PostMetric dashboard
3. You should see your visit appear in real-time

<Warning>
  It may take a few seconds for visits to appear in your dashboard. If you don't
  see your visit, check that the tracking script is correctly installed.
</Warning>
