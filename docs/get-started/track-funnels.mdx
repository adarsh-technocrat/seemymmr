Track multi-step conversion funnels to understand where users drop off and optimize your conversion process.

## What are funnels?

Funnels track a series of steps that users take to complete a goal. For example:

1. **Landing page** - User visits your landing page
2. **Sign up** - User creates an account
3. **Trial** - User starts a trial
4. **Purchase** - User makes a purchase

## Create a funnel

1. Go to your website settings in the dashboard
2. Click **"Funnels"** in the sidebar
3. Click **"Create Funnel"**
4. Enter:
   - **Name** - A descriptive name (e.g., "Signup to Purchase")
   - **Steps** - Add each step in order

## Funnel steps

Each funnel step can be:

- **Page path** - A specific URL path (e.g., `/pricing`)
- **Goal event** - A custom goal event (e.g., `signup_click`)
- **Combination** - Both path and goal

### Example funnel

```
Step 1: Landing Page (/)
Step 2: Pricing Page (/pricing)
Step 3: Signup Goal (signup_click)
Step 4: Purchase Goal (purchase)
```

## Track funnel progress

Funnels are automatically tracked when users complete steps. The tracking script detects:

- Page views (for path-based steps)
- Goal events (for goal-based steps)

## View funnel data

In your dashboard, you can view:

- **Funnel visualization** - See the funnel flow
- **Conversion rate** - Percentage of users who complete each step
- **Drop-off points** - Where users leave the funnel
- **Time between steps** - How long users take between steps
- **Funnel by source** - Which traffic sources have the best conversion rates

## Example: E-commerce funnel

```
Step 1: Homepage (/)
Step 2: Product Page (/products)
Step 3: Add to Cart Goal (add_to_cart)
Step 4: Checkout Page (/checkout)
Step 5: Purchase Goal (purchase)
```

## Example: SaaS signup funnel

```
Step 1: Landing Page (/)
Step 2: Pricing Page (/pricing)
Step 3: Signup Click Goal (signup_click)
Step 4: Signup Form (/signup)
Step 5: Trial Started Goal (trial_started)
Step 6: Purchase Goal (purchase)
```

## Best practices

1. **Keep it simple** - Start with 3-5 steps
2. **Use clear step names** - Make it easy to understand each step
3. **Track meaningful actions** - Focus on steps that matter to your business
4. **Analyze drop-offs** - Identify where users leave and optimize those steps
