Use URL tracking parameters to understand where your traffic comes from and which campaigns drive the most value.

## UTM parameters

UTM parameters are automatically captured by PostMetric. Add them to your URLs:

```
https://example.com?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=summer_sale
```

### Supported UTM parameters

- `utm_source` - The source of traffic (e.g., google, facebook, newsletter)
- `utm_medium` - The medium (e.g., cpc, email, social)
- `utm_campaign` - The campaign name (e.g., summer_sale, product_launch)
- `utm_term` - The keyword (mainly for paid search)
- `utm_content` - Additional content identifier (e.g., ad_variant_a)

## Referrer tracking

PostMetric automatically tracks referrers. When a user clicks a link to your site, the referrer is captured.

## View tracking data

In your dashboard, you can view:

- **Source breakdown** - See traffic by source (Google, Facebook, Direct, etc.)
- **Campaign performance** - Compare campaign performance
- **Medium analysis** - See which mediums drive the most traffic
- **Keyword tracking** - View which keywords drive traffic (for paid search)

## Best practices

### 1. Use consistent naming

Use consistent naming conventions for your UTM parameters:

```
utm_source=google
utm_medium=cpc
utm_campaign=summer_sale_2024
```

### 2. Track all campaigns

Add UTM parameters to all your marketing links:

- Email campaigns
- Social media posts
- Paid ads
- Affiliate links
- Blog posts

### 3. Use lowercase

Use lowercase for UTM values to avoid duplicates:

```
❌ utm_source=Google
✅ utm_source=google
```

### 4. Track internal links

You can also track internal links by adding UTM parameters:

```html
<a href="/pricing?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=cta">
  View Pricing
</a>
```

## Example URLs

### Email campaign

```
https://example.com/pricing?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=monthly_update
```

### Social media post

```
https://example.com/blog/post?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=blog_promotion
```

### Paid ad

```
https://example.com?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=summer_sale&utm_term=analytics
```

## Filter by tracking parameters

In your dashboard, you can filter analytics by:

- Source
- Medium
- Campaign
- Keyword

This helps you understand which campaigns drive the most traffic and revenue.
