Track any user action as a conversion goal to measure what matters to your business.

## What are goals?

Goals are custom events that you want to track, such as:

- Button clicks
- Form submissions
- Video plays
- File downloads
- Newsletter signups
- Product purchases
- Any custom user action

## Create a goal

1. Go to your website settings in the dashboard
2. Click **"Goals"** in the sidebar
3. Click **"Create Goal"**
4. Enter:
   - **Name** - A descriptive name (e.g., "Newsletter Signup")
   - **Event** - The event identifier (e.g., "newsletter_signup")
   - **Description** - Optional description

## Track goals with JavaScript

### Method 1: Using the tracking function

```javascript
seeMoreThanMMR("track", "goal", {
  event: "newsletter_signup",
  value: 0, // Optional: numeric value
});
```

### Method 2: HTML onclick

```html
<button onclick="seeMoreThanMMR('track', 'goal', { event: 'button_click' })">
  Click me
</button>
```

### Method 3: React/Vue event handlers

```tsx
// React
<button
  onClick={() => {
    window.seeMoreThanMMR("track", "goal", { event: "button_click" });
  }}
>
  Click me
</button>
```

```vue
<!-- Vue -->
<button @click="trackGoal">
  Click me
</button>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    trackGoal() {
      window.seeMoreThanMMR("track", "goal", { event: "button_click" });
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

## Track goals with value

Track goals with a numeric value (e.g., purchase amount):

```javascript
seeMoreThanMMR("track", "goal", {
  event: "purchase",
  value: 99.99,
});
```

## Track goals via API

You can also track goals server-side using our API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/v1/goal \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event": "newsletter_signup",
    "value": 0,
    "visitorId": "visitor_123",
    "sessionId": "session_456"
  }'
```

See our [Goal API documentation](/api-reference/goal) for more details.

## View goal data

In your dashboard, you can view:

- **Goal completions** - Number of times each goal was completed
- **Conversion rate** - Percentage of visitors who completed the goal
- **Goal value** - Total value of goal completions
- **Goal by source** - Which traffic sources drive the most goal completions
- **Goal over time** - Goal completions over time

## Common goal examples

### Form submission

```javascript
document.getElementById("contact-form").addEventListener("submit", function () {
  seeMoreThanMMR("track", "goal", { event: "form_submit" });
});
```

### Button click

```javascript
document.getElementById("cta-button").addEventListener("click", function () {
  seeMoreThanMMR("track", "goal", { event: "cta_click" });
});
```

### Video play

```javascript
document.getElementById("video").addEventListener("play", function () {
  seeMoreThanMMR("track", "goal", { event: "video_play" });
});
```

### File download

```html
<a
  href="/download.pdf"
  onclick="seeMoreThanMMR('track', 'goal', { event: 'pdf_download' })"
>
  Download PDF
</a>
```

## Best practices

1. **Use descriptive event names** - Use clear, consistent naming (e.g., `newsletter_signup`, not `ns`)
2. **Track meaningful actions** - Focus on actions that matter to your business
3. **Include values when relevant** - Add numeric values for revenue-related goals
4. **Test your goals** - Verify goals are tracking correctly before relying on the data
