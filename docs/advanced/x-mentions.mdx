Track when your website is mentioned on X (Twitter) and see which tweets drive traffic and revenue.

## How it works

PostMetric automatically tracks X mentions when:

1. A tweet contains a link to your website
2. Someone clicks that link
3. The referrer is identified as X/Twitter

## View X mentions

In your dashboard, you can view:

- **X mentions** - Number of times your site was mentioned
- **Traffic from X** - Visitors who came from X
- **Revenue from X** - Revenue attributed to X traffic
- **Top tweets** - Which tweets drive the most traffic

## X link attribution

When a user clicks a link from X, PostMetric captures:

- The referrer (X/Twitter)
- UTM parameters (if included in the tweet)
- The tweet URL (if available)

## Track tweet performance

To see which specific tweets drive traffic:

1. Include UTM parameters in your tweet links
2. Use unique UTM parameters for each tweet
3. View traffic by campaign in your dashboard

Example tweet link:

```
https://example.com?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tweet_123
```

## Best practices

1. **Use UTM parameters** - Add UTM parameters to track specific tweets
2. **Monitor mentions** - Regularly check X mentions in your dashboard
3. **Engage with mentions** - Respond to tweets that mention your site
4. **Track revenue** - See which tweets drive actual revenue, not just traffic
