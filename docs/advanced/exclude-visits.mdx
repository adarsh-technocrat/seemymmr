Exclude specific visits from your analytics to get more accurate data.

## Why exclude visits?

- **Exclude your own visits** - Don't count your own testing and development
- **Exclude internal traffic** - Don't count visits from your team
- **Exclude test environments** - Exclude staging or development sites
- **Exclude specific pages** - Exclude admin pages or internal tools

## Exclude your IP

1. Go to your website settings in the dashboard
2. Click **"Settings"** → **"Exclusions"**
3. Add your IP address to the **"Excluded IPs"** list
4. Click **"Save"**

Your visits from that IP will no longer be counted.

## Exclude countries

Exclude entire countries from your analytics:

1. Go to **"Settings"** → **"Exclusions"**
2. Add countries to the **"Excluded Countries"** list
3. Click **"Save"**

## Exclude hostnames

Exclude specific hostnames (subdomains):

1. Go to **"Settings"** → **"Exclusions"**
2. Add hostnames to the **"Excluded Hostnames"** list
   - Example: `admin.example.com`, `staging.example.com`
3. Click **"Save"**

## Exclude paths

Exclude specific URL paths:

1. Go to **"Settings"** → **"Exclusions"**
2. Add paths to the **"Excluded Paths"** list
   - Example: `/admin`, `/wp-admin`, `/api`
3. Click **"Save"**

## Multiple exclusions

You can combine multiple exclusion rules:

- Exclude IP `1.2.3.4` AND country `US` AND path `/admin`
- All conditions must match for a visit to be excluded

## View excluded visits

Excluded visits are not stored in your database, so they won't appear in your analytics at all.

## Best practices

1. **Exclude your IP** - Always exclude your own IP address
2. **Exclude test environments** - Exclude staging and development sites
3. **Exclude admin pages** - Exclude internal admin interfaces
4. **Review regularly** - Review your exclusion rules periodically
