Connect your payment provider to see which marketing channels drive revenue, not just traffic.

## Why revenue attribution?

Revenue attribution helps you:

- **See ROI** - Understand which campaigns drive revenue, not just traffic
- **Optimize spend** - Focus your marketing budget on channels that convert
- **Measure success** - Track revenue by source, campaign, and keyword
- **Make data-driven decisions** - Use revenue data to guide your marketing strategy

## How it works

1. **Track visitors** - PostMetric tracks all visitors to your site
2. **Record payments** - When a payment is completed, it's recorded in PostMetric
3. **Link payments to visitors** - Payments are linked to visitors using:
   - Visitor/session IDs (most reliable)
   - Email matching (if user identification is enabled)
   - Timestamp correlation (fallback)
4. **View revenue data** - See revenue by source, campaign, and more in your dashboard

## Setup methods

### Method 1: Webhooks (Recommended)

Webhooks automatically send payment data to PostMetric when a payment is completed. This is the most reliable method.

### Method 2: API

Record payments manually using our API. This is useful for custom payment providers or server-side implementations.

See our [Payment API documentation](/api-reference/payment) for details.

## Linking payments to visitors

For best results, include visitor/session IDs in your payment metadata:

```javascript
// When creating a payment
const payment = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  // ... payment config
  metadata: {
    visitorId: window.postMetric?.getVisitorId(),
    sessionId: window.postMetric?.getSessionId(),
  },
});
```

## View revenue data

Once payments are linked, you can view:

- **Revenue over time** - See revenue trends
- **Revenue by source** - Which channels drive the most revenue
- **Revenue by campaign** - Campaign performance
- **Conversion rates** - Revenue per visitor by source
- **Average order value** - AOV by source
